=================================  (1) Income Sliders  =================================

The very nature of this mod significantly reduces both Science income and Funding income.
You may need to use settings that are different from what you are used to.
Seriously, don't just press the default "Hard" button and call it a day. I call this "Impossible Mode"
and there are users currently challenging themselves to see if this is even possible (I predict it isn't).

Recommended minimum for the Science slider is 70%.
	- Planet packs are one of the few circumstance I can imagine that could justify a lower
	  setting, but none are officially supported yet.
	  
Recommended minimum for the Funding slider is 80%.
	- If you use MANY part-adding mods, you may need to set it HIGHER.
	  Remember, more part-mods means you'll be spending more on unlocking and using parts.


================================= (2) Science Definitions =================================

This is just a quick note for users who wish to alter the Science Definitions made by this mod.
If you prefer to see the science reward values of vanilla or a different mod,

First find the
	= = Zs_Science.cfg
file contained within 
	= = GameData/ProbesBeforeCrew/_Core
and delete/remove the file.
You could also rename the EXTENSION to disable the file, for example
	= = Zs_Science.txt

The |ScienceParamModifier| mod by DMagic packaged with this mod also overhauls Celestial Body Science Multipliers.
If you deleted/removed/renamed the Zs_Science.cfg file above, then you will probably also want to delete this entire folder
	= = GameData/ScienceParamModifier

	
Everything else will remain as PBC defines, including where the experiment parts are supposed to be on the tech tree.


================================= (3) Kerbalism Users =================================

Starting with Kerbalism version 3.0.0, PBC's science reward tweaks will defer to Kerbalism's science reward tweaks when you 
have enabled Kerbalism's Science Module. If you prefer PBC's system of collecting and turning in science (much more
like vanilla) then follow Kerbalism's instructions for turning off it's Science Module. No editting of files is necessary,
it will automatically enable/disable itself depending on the Kerbalism setting you've selected.


================================= (4) END =================================
